# Bytecode

## Optimizations

- Instruction and operand specialization

- Optimized upvalue storage

- Fast method calls

- Specialized built-in function calls

- Closure Caching

- Array/Table iteration

- Optimized array/table lookups

- Constant folding

- Strength reduction

- Inlining

- Optimizing import chains for variables and functions

- Composite conditional branch-series transformation

- Elimination of conditionals (usually ternaries)

- Elimination of uneeded results

- Table templates

- Inline caching/HREFK
