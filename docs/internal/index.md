# Internal Documentation

This area of documentation aims to describe and document the internal design of the runtime and associated components
and the reasoning behind them. This is mostly intended as a reference for developers working on Zaia itself
and not for people looking to interact with the project as a user.

Below is a list of links to pages that contain further documentation about various overarching concepts.

- [Pipeline](/docs/internal/pipeline.md)
