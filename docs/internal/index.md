# Internal Documentation

This area of documentation aims to describe and document the internal design of the runtime and associated components
and the reasoning behind them. This is mostly intended as a reference for developers working on Zaia itself
and not for people looking to interact with it as a user.

Below is a list of links to pages that contain further documentation about various overarching concepts.

- [Pipeline](/docs/internal/pipeline.md)
- [Parser](/docs/internal/parser.md)
- [CST and AST](/docs/internal/cst-ast.md)
- [IR](/docs/internal/ir.md)
- [Bytecode](/docs/internal/bytecode.md)
- [Virtual Machine](/docs/internal/virtual-machine.md)
